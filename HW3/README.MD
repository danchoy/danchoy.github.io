# Dynamic Multiplication Table
This application is a web-based tool for generating and displaying a dynamic multiplication table. The main functionality is provided through a JavaScript file (script.js) and the user interface is styled with a CSS file (styles.css).

## Functionality
The application accepts user input for the minimum and maximum values for both rows and columns. It then generates a multiplication table based on these inputs. The application is designed to handle large number inputs efficiently by displaying the multiplication table in pages, each containing up to 2500 cells (50 rows * 50 columns). This design helps prevent potential browser crashes from trying to render too much data at once.

Additionally, the application validates user input to ensure only integer values are accepted. If a non-integer value is input, an error message is displayed.

The application also supports keyboard navigation. The "previous" and "next" buttons navigate through the columns, while the "up" and "down" buttons navigate through the rows. These functionalities are also associated with the left, right, up, and down arrow keys respectively.
