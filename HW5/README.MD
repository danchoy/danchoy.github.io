# Game of Scrabble
This Scrabble Game is an interactive and engaging application designed to mimic the popular board game, Scrabble. The application is equipped with features such as a resizable game board, droppable game pieces, dynamic score update, and user-friendly messages for successful moves and error states.


## Features

# Droppable Game Pieces
This feature allows the player to drag and drop the game pieces onto the game board. Each game piece is equipped with a draggable property while each cell on the board is a droppable zone. The interaction between draggable and droppable properties enables seamless gameplay.

# Dynamic Score Update
The Scrabble Game application dynamically updates the score as the player forms words on the board. The scoring system is in line with traditional Scrabble rules, assigning different point values to different letters.

# User-Friendly Messages
The application provides user-friendly messages for successful moves and error states. For instance, when a player forms a valid word, a success message is displayed, and the word is highlighted on the board. Conversely, if an invalid move is attempted, an error message is displayed to guide the player.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Drag and drop game pieces onto the game board to form words.
2. The score gets updated dynamically as you form words on the board.
3. Error and success messages guide you throughout the gameplay. They appear based on your moves and help in improving the gaming experience.
